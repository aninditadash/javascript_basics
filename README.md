# Introduction to Javascript

JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive. It is an interpreted language that executes code line by line, providing more flexibility. It is a single-threaded programming language that we can use for client-side or server-side development. It is a dynamically typed programming language.

#### Key Features of Javascript

- **Browser Support:** All browsers support JavaScript, as all modern browser comes with the built-in JavaScript execution environment.
- **Dom Manipulation:** JavaScript allows manipulation of the webpage elements, as it contains the various methods to access the DOM elements using different attributes and allows to customize the HTML elements.
- **Client-Side Scripting:** JavaScript runs on the user's browser, so has a faster response time without needing to communicate with the server.
- **Versatile:** JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex server-side applications.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** JavaScript can respond to user actions (clicks, keystrokes) in real-time.
- **Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript decides the type of variables at runtime. So, no need to specify variable data type while writing the code, providing more flexibility to write code.
- **Functional Programming:** It supports the functional programming. In JavaScript, you can define the first-class function, pure functions, closures, higher-order functions, arrow functions, function expressions, etc.
- **Object-oriented Programming:** JavaScript contains classes, and we can implement object-oriented programming concepts using its functionality.
- **Asynchronous:** As JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, to execute the code faster, we can use asynchronous programming. For example, JavaScript can handle tasks like fetching data from servers without freezing the user interface.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which make development faster and more efficient.
- **Server-side Support:** Node.js and frameworks like Express.js are widely used for server-side JavaScript, enabling full-stack development.
